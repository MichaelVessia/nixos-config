Be extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
When making a plan, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.
Make small changes that compile and pass tests
Never disable tests, always fix them.
Never commit code that doesn't compile unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
Never use --no-verify to bypass commit hooks unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
